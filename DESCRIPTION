Description: Runs a transient tree trunk temperature model to provide temperature 
  estimates in a user-specified number of segements and concentric rings. Outputs from
  an inbuilt microclimate model are used as inputs to the tree-trunk model. The 
  microclimate model is based on the localised near-field theory model described by 
  Raupach (1989), with the distribution of heat sources and sinks derived from solar
  radiation using methods described in Campbell & Normam (2012). Radiation transmission 
  through the canopy is modelled using the variant of the Dickenson-Sellers two-stream 
  model described by Yuan et al (2017).
